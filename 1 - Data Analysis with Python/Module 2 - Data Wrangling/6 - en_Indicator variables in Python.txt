In this video, we’ll discuss how to turn categorical variables into quantitative variables
in Python.
Most statistical models cannot take in objects or strings as input and, for model training,
only take the numbers as inputs.
In the car dataset, the "fuel-type" feature as a categorical variable has two values,
"gas" or "diesel”, which are in String format.
For further analysis, Jerry has to convert these variables into some form of numeric
format.
We encode the values by adding new features corresponding to each unique element in the
original feature we would like to encode.
In the case where the feature “Fuel” has two unique values, gas and diesel, we create
two new features ‘gas’ and ‘diesel.'
When a value occurs in the original feature we set the corresponding value to one in the
new feature; the rest of the features are set to zero.
In the fuel example, for car B, the fuel value is diesel.
Therefore, we set the feature diesel equal to one and the gas feature to zero.
Similarly, for car D the fuel value is gas.
Therefore we set the feature gas equal to one and the feature diesel equal to zero.
This technique is often called “one-hot encoding”.
In pandas, we can use get_dummies() method to convert categorical variables to dummy
variables.
In Python, transforming categorical variables to dummy variables is simple.
Following the example, pd.get_dummies() method gets the fuel-type column and creates the
dataframe"dummy_variable_1".
The get_dummies() method automatically generates a list of numbers, each one corresponding
to a particular category of the variable.
