In this module we’re going to cover the basics of Exploratory Data Analysis using
Python.
Exploratory Data Analysis, or in short “EDA”, is an approach to analyze data in order to:
- summarize main characteristics of the data - gain better understanding of the dataset,
- uncover relationships between different variables, and
- extract important variables for the problem we are trying to solve.
The main question we are trying to answer in this module is:
“What are the characteristics that have the most impact on the car price?”
We will be going through a couple of different useful exploratory data analysis techniques
in order to answer this question.
In this module you will learn about: Descriptive Statistics, which describe basic
features of a dataset and obtains a short summary about the sample and measures of the
data.
Basic of Grouping Data using group by, and how this can help to transform our dataset.
ANOVA, the analysis of variance, a statistical method in which the variation in a set of
observations is divided into distinct components.
The Correlation between different variables.
And lastly, Advanced Correlation, where we’ll introduce you to various correlation statistical
methods, namely Pearson Correlation and Correlation Heatmaps.
