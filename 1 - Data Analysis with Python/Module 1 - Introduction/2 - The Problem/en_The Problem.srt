In this video, we&#39;ll be talking about data analysis and the scenario in which we&#39;ll

1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:08,370
be playing the data analyst or data scientist.

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,090
But before we begin talking about the problem (used car prices), we should first understand

3
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,679
the importance of data analysis.

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,230
As you know, data is collected everywhere around us, whether it&#39;s collected manually

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,949
by scientists, or collected digitally every time you click on a website or your mobile

6
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:25,949
device.

7
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:28,930
But data does not mean information.

8
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,920
Data analysis, and in essence, data science, helps us unlock the information and insights

9
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,100
from raw data, to answer our questions.

10
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,600
So data analysis plays an important role by helping us to discover useful information

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,420
from the data, answer questions, and even predict the future or the unknown.

12
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,940
So let&#39;s begin with our scenario.

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,160
Let&#39;s say we have a friend named Tom.

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,120
And Tom wants to sell his car.

15
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,350
But the problem is, he doesn&#39;t know how much he should sell his car for.

16
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,309
Tom wants to sell his car for as much as he can.

17
00:01:01,309 --> 00:01:06,340
But he also wants to set the price reasonably so someone would want to purchase it.

18
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:10,200
So the price he sets should represent the value of the car.

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,330
How can we help Tom determine the best price for his car?

20
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:18,590
Let&#39;s think like data scientists and clearly define some of his problems:

21
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:23,800
For example, is there data on the prices of other cars and their characteristics?

22
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,540
What features of cars affect their prices?

23
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,540
Colour?

24
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,540
Brand?

25
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:33,250
Does horsepower also affect the selling price, or perhaps, something else?

26
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,500
As a data analyst or data scientist, these are some of the questions we can start thinking

27
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,880
about.

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,290
To answer these questions, we&#39;re going to need some data.

29
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,690
In the next videos, we&#39;ll be going into how to understand the data, how to import

30
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:50,860
it into Python, and how to begin looking into some basic insights from the data.
