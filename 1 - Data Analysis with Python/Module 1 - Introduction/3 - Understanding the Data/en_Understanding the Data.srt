In this video we&#39;ll be looking at the dataset on used car prices.

1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,780
The dataset used in this course is an open dataset, by Jeffrey C. Schlimmer.

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,969
This dataset is in CSV format, which separates each of the values with commas, making it

3
00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:18,590
very easy to import in most tools or applications.

4
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:21,470
Each line represents a row in the dataset.

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:26,949
In the hands-on lab for this module, you&#39;ll be able to download and use the CSV file.

6
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:30,010
Do you notice anything different about the first row?

7
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,870
Sometimes the first row is a header which contains a column name for each of the 26

8
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:35,870
columns.

9
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,399
But in this example, it&#39;s just another row of data.

10
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,699
So here&#39;s the documentation on what each of the 26 columns represent.

11
00:00:43,699 --> 00:00:47,891
There are a lot of columns, and I&#39;ll just go through a few of the column names, but

12
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:51,760
you can also check out the link at the bottom of the slide to go through the descriptions

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,109
yourself.

14
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:58,690
The first attribute, &quot;symboling&quot;, corresponds to the insurance risk level of a car.

15
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,680
Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with their price.

16
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,730
Then, if an automobile is more risky, this symbol is adjusted by moving it up the scale.

17
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:15,680
A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe.

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,740
The second attribute &quot;normalized-losses&quot; is the relative average loss payment per insured

19
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,380
vehicle year.

20
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,780
This value is normalized for all autos within a particular size classification (two-door

21
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,730
small, station wagons, sports/speciality, etc...), and represents the average loss per

22
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:35,590
car per year.

23
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:39,540
The values range from 65 to 256.

24
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,200
The other attributes are easy to understand.

25
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,910
If you would like to check out more details, refer to the link at the bottom of the slide.

26
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:52,470
Ok, after we understand the meaning of each feature, we&#39;ll notice that the 26th attribute

27
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,470
is &quot;price&quot;.

28
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,750
This is our target value, or label, in other words.

29
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,640
This means &quot;price&quot; is the value that we want to predict from the dataset, and the

30
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,080
predictors should be all the other variables listed, like &quot;symboling&quot;, &quot;normalized-losses&quot;,

31
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,069
&quot;make&quot; and so on.

32
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:14,310
Thus, the goal of this project is to predict &quot;price&quot; in terms of other car features.

33
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:19,909
Just a quick note, this dataset is actually from 1985, so the car prices for the models

34
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:24,840
may seem a little low, but just bear in mind that the goal of this exercise is to learn

35
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,150
how to analyze the data.
