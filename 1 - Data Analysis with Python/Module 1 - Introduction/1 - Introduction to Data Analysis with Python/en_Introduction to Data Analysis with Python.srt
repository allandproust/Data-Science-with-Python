Welcome to this module on Introduction to Data Analysis with Python.

1
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:10,620
In this module, you&#39;ll learn about an example around estimating used car prices that we

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:13,950
will analyze in this course, using Python.

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,099
Then we will introduce an overview of Python packages used for data analysis.

4
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:24,720
And finally, you will learn about how to import and export data in and from Python, and how

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,809
to obtain basic insights from the dataset on used cars and their prices.

6
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:36,040
So to learn how to analyze data in Python, we&#39;ll be answering the following question:

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,710
&quot;Can we estimate the price of a used car based on its characteristics?&quot;

8
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,240
To answer this question, we are going to use various Python packages to perform data cleaning,

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,500
exploratory data analysis, model development and model evaluation.
