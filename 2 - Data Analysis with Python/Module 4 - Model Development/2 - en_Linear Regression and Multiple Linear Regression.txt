In this video, we’ll be talking about simple linear regression and multiple linear regression.
Linear Regression will refer to one independent variable to make a prediction.
Multiple Linear Regression will refer to multiple independent variables to make a prediction.
Simple Linear Regression (or SLR) is: A method to help us understand the relationship between
two variables: The predictor (independent) variable x, and the target (dependent) variable y.
We would like to come up with a linear relationship
between the variables shown here. - The parameter b zero is the intercept
- The parameter b one is the slope When we fit or train the model, we will come
up with these parameters. This step requires lots of math, so we will not focus on this
part. Let’s clarify the prediction step. It’s hard to figure out how much a car costs,
but the Highway Miles per Gallon is in the owner’s manual. If we assume, there is a
linear relationship between these variables, we can use this relationship to formulate
a model to determine the price of the car. If the Highway Miles per Gallon is 20, we
can input his value into the model to obtain a prediction of $22,000.
In order to determine the line, we take data points from our data set marked in red here.
We then use these training points to fit our model; the results of the training points
are the parameters. We usually store the data points in two dataframe
or numpy arrays. The value we would like to predict is called
the target that we store in the array y, we store the dependent variable in the dataframe
or array X. Each sample corresponds to a different row
in each dataframe or array. In many cases, many factors influence how
much people pay for a car, for example, make or how old the car is. In this model, this
uncertainty is taken into account by assuming a small random value is added to the point
on the line; this is called noise. The figure on the left shows the distribution
of the noise. The vertical axis shows the value added and the horizontal axis illustrates
the probability that the value will be added. Usually, a small positive value is added,
or a small negative value. Sometimes large values are added, but for the most part, the
values added are near zero. We can summarize the process like this:
- We have a set of training points - We use these training points to fit or train
the model and get parameters - We then use these parameters in the model
- We now have a model; we use the hat on the y to denote the model is an estimate
- We can use this model to predict values that we haven't seen.
For example, we have no car with 20 Highway Miles per Gallon, we can use our model to
make a prediction for the price of this car. But don't forget our model is not always correct.
We can see this by comparing the predicted value to the actual value.
We have a sample for 10 Highway Miles per Gallon, but the predicted value does not match
the actual value. If the linear assumption is correct this error
is due to the noise but there can be other reasons.
To fit the model in Python, first we import linear model from scikit-learn; then Create
a Linear Regression Object using the constructor. We define the predictor variable and target
variable. Then use the method fit to fit the model and
find the parameters b0 and b1. The input are the features and the targets.
We can obtain a prediction using the method predict.
The output is an array, the array has the same number of samples as the input X.
The intercept (b0) is an attribute of the object “lm”.
The slope (b1) is also an attribute of the object “lm”.
The Relationship between Price and Highway MPG is given by this equation in bold: “Price
= 38,423.31 minus 821.73 times highway mpg” like the equation we discussed before.
Multiple Linear Regression is used to explain the relationship between
- One continuous target (Y) variable, and - Two or more predictor (X) variables.
If we have for example 4 predictor variables, then:
- B0: intercept (X=0) - B1: the coefficient or parameter of 𝑋1:
- B2: the coefficient of parameter 𝑋2: and so on
If there are only two variables then we can visualize the values. Consider the following function.
The variables 𝑋1and 𝑋2 can be visualized on a 2D plane; let’s do an example on the
next slide. The table contains different values of the
predictor variables 𝑋1 and 𝑋2. The position of each point is placed on the 2D plane, color
coded accordingly. Each value of the predictor variables 𝑋1 and
𝑋2 will be mapped to a new value 𝑌 (y hat) the new values of 𝑌 (y hat) are mapped
in the vertical direction, with height proportional to the value that yhat takes.
We can fit the Multiple linear regression as follows:
- We can extract the 4 predictor variables and store them in the variable Z.
- Then train the model as before using the method train, with the features or depended
variables and the targets : (colon) We can also obtain a prediction using the
method predict. In this case, the input is an array or dataframe with 4 columns, the
number of rows correspond to the number of samples.
The output is an array with the same number of elements as number of samples.
The intercept is an attribute of the object. And the coefficients are also attributes.
It is helpful to visualize the equation, replacing the dependent variable names with actual names.
This is identical to the form we discussed earlier.
